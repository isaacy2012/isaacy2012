### <img src="https://github.com/isaacy2012/isaacyoung/blob/main/img/IY.svg"  width="25" height="25"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Isaac, a third year Software Engineering student at Victoria University of Wellington and Software Engineer Intern at IMC Trading.

I'm currently working on a batch QR scanning app called **[MultiQR](https://github.com/isaacy2012/MultiQR)** which aims to speed up data entry and validation. I'll be making a new version for Victoria University of Wellington, coming soon!

<!-- I'm also working on a React web app written in Typescript called **[Observer](https://github.com/isaacy2012/Observer)** which helps people collect and visualise feedback.
